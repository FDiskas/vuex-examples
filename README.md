### Getting Started

#### With Vue-CLI
Each project is created using [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli)'s [webpack-simple template](https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack-simple) so you could just pick the first project on the list and run
```
vue init webpack-simple counter
```
> make sure you have vue-cli installed on your computer before running the command.

#### By Cloning this Repo
You could as well, clone this repository and use it that way :sweat_smile:
I already added the template for creating a store, installing Vuex and injecting it to our app.

### Running the App
``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
